   Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install requests dnspython ssl nmap pwntools metasploit ascii_magic colorama pyfiglet playsound
   sudo apt-get install ncat hydra
   ```

   Place the `jingle_bells.mp3` file in the same directory as the script.

   ```

---
3️⃣ **Inputs Required**:
   - Enter the website URL you want to scan (e.g., `https://example.com`).
   - Provide custom Nmap switches for detailed scanning (e.g., `-sV --script=vuln`).

4️⃣ **Features**:
   - **HTTP Header Analysis**: Fetches and displays the HTTP headers of the target website.
   - **IP Address Resolution**: Resolves the target's IP address.
   - **DNS Lookup**: Fetches DNS A records.

   - **Nmap Scanning**: Performs detailed port and service scans with user-specified options.
   - **Christmas Effects**: Displays festive banners, ASCII art, and plays Christmas jingles.
   - **HTML Report Generation**: Saves a detailed pentesting report as `pentest_report.html`.
